skin cancer — the abnormal growth of skin cells — most often develops on skin exposed to the sun. but this common form of cancer can also occur on areas of your skin not ordinarily exposed to sunlight.
there are three major types of skin cancer — basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma.
you can reduce your risk of skin cancer by limiting or avoiding exposure to ultraviolet  uv  radiation. checking your skin for suspicious changes can help detect skin cancer at its earliest stages. early detection of skin cancer gives you the greatest chance for successful skin cancer treatment.

basal cell carcinoma is a type of skin cancer that most often develops on areas of skin exposed to the sun. this photograph shows a basal cell carcinoma that affects the skin on the lower eyelid.

sun exposed areas such as the lips and ears are especially likely to develop squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.
sun exposed areas such as the lips and ears are especially likely to develop squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.
the first sign of melanoma is often a mole that changes size, shape or color. this melanoma shows color variations and an irregular border, both of which are melanoma warning signs.

merkel cell carcinoma is a rare, aggressive skin cancer. it appears as a painless, flesh colored or bluish red nodule growing on your skin.

skin cancer develops primarily on areas of sun exposed skin, including the scalp, face, lips, ears, neck, chest, arms and hands, and on the legs in women. but it can also form on areas that rarely see the light of day — your palms, beneath your fingernails or toenails, and your genital area.
skin cancer affects people of all skin tones, including those with darker complexions. when melanoma occurs in people with dark skin tones, it s more likely to occur in areas not normally exposed to the sun, such as the palms of the hands and soles of the feet.
basal cell carcinoma usually occurs in sun exposed areas of your body, such as your neck or face.

most often, squamous cell carcinoma occurs on sun exposed areas of your body, such as your face, ears and hands. people with darker skin are more likely to develop squamous cell carcinoma on areas that aren t often exposed to the sun.
squamous cell carcinoma may appear as 
melanoma can develop anywhere on your body, in otherwise normal skin or in an existing mole that becomes cancerous. melanoma most often appears on the face or the trunk of affected men. in women, this type of cancer most often develops on the lower legs. in both men and women, melanoma can occur on skin that hasn t been exposed to the sun.
melanoma can affect people of any skin tone. in people with darker skin tones, melanoma tends to occur on the palms or soles, or under the fingernails or toenails.
melanoma signs include 
other, less common types of skin cancer include 
kaposi sarcoma. this rare form of skin cancer develops in the skin s blood vessels and causes red or purple patches on the skin or mucous membranes.
kaposi sarcoma mainly occurs in people with weakened immune systems, such as people with aids, and in people taking medications that suppress their natural immunity, such as people who ve undergone organ transplants.
other people with an increased risk of kaposi sarcoma include young men living in africa or older men of italian or eastern european jewish heritage.
make an appointment with your doctor if you notice any changes to your skin that worry you. not all skin changes are caused by skin cancer. your doctor will investigate your skin changes to determine a cause.
skin cancer begins in the cells that make up the outer layer  epidermis  of your skin. one type of skin cancer called basal cell carcinoma begins in the basal cells, which make skin cells that continuously push older cells toward the surface. as new cells move upward, they become flattened squamous cells, where a skin cancer called squamous cell carcinoma can occur. melanoma, another type of skin cancer, arises in the pigment cells  melanocytes .

skin cancer occurs when errors  mutations  occur in the dna of skin cells. the mutations cause the cells to grow out of control and form a mass of cancer cells.
skin cancer begins in your skin s top layer — the epidermis. the epidermis is a thin layer that provides a protective cover of skin cells that your body continually sheds. the epidermis contains three main types of cells 
where your skin cancer begins determines its type and your treatment options.
much of the damage to dna in skin cells results from ultraviolet  uv  radiation found in sunlight and in the lights used in tanning beds. but sun exposure doesn t explain skin cancers that develop on skin not ordinarily exposed to sunlight. this indicates that other factors may contribute to your risk of skin cancer, such as being exposed to toxic substances or having a condition that weakens your immune system.
factors that may increase your risk of skin cancer include 
most skin cancers are preventable. to protect yourself, follow these skin cancer prevention tips 
avoid the sun during the middle of the day. for many people in north america, the sun s rays are strongest between about 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. schedule outdoor activities for other times of the day, even in winter or when the sky is cloudy.
you absorb uv radiation year round, and clouds offer little protection from damaging rays. avoiding the sun at its strongest helps you avoid the sunburns and suntans that cause skin damage and increase your risk of developing skin cancer. sun exposure accumulated over time also may cause skin cancer.
wear sunscreen year round. sunscreens don t filter out all harmful uv radiation, especially the radiation that can lead to melanoma. but they play a major role in an overall sun protection program.
use a broad spectrum sunscreen with an spf of at least 30, even on cloudy days. apply sunscreen generously, and reapply every two hours — or more often if you re swimming or perspiring. use a generous amount of sunscreen on all exposed skin, including your lips, the tips of your ears, and the backs of your hands and neck.
wear protective clothing. sunscreens don t provide complete protection from uv rays. so cover your skin with dark, tightly woven clothing that covers your arms and legs, and a broad brimmed hat, which provides more protection than a baseball cap or visor does.
some companies also sell photoprotective clothing. a dermatologist can recommend an appropriate brand.
don t forget sunglasses. look for those that block both types of uv radiation — uva and uvb rays.
be aware of sun sensitizing medications. some common prescription and over the counter drugs, including antibiotics, can make your skin more sensitive to sunlight.
ask your doctor or pharmacist about the side effects of any medications you take. if they increase your sensitivity to sunlight, take extra precautions to stay out of the sun in order to protect your skin.
check your skin regularly and report changes to your doctor. examine your skin often for new skin growths or changes in existing moles, freckles, bumps and birthmarks.
with the help of mirrors, check your face, neck, ears and scalp. examine your chest and trunk, and the tops and undersides of your arms and hands. examine both the front and back of your legs, and your feet, including the soles and the spaces between your toes. also check your genital area and between your buttocks.
